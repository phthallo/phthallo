### about me
hello! I'm a high school student (they/them) who codes random stuff, sometimes. currently i'm working on: 
- a [service](https://github.com/phthallo/toyhouse-character-checker) to retrieve character interations on [toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se), a character repository website
- a downloadable [productivity app](https://github.com/phthallo/chillist) in python as my aif output of learning
- self-learning some uni coursework [comp1511] (:D hoping to study compsci in the future)
- a mod for the video game hollow knight <sup>(you should play hollow knight! on that note you should play [celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) too)</sup>

i've previously made:
- [2023] a [cli for downloading fanworks](https://github.com/phthallo/ao3downloader) from archiveofourown (it's... functional, pun 100% intended)
- [2022] a [point-and-click game](https://github.com/phthallo/cryptologygame) with pygame (the way i literally just didn't pass arguments to functions)
